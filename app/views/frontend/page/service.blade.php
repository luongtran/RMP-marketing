									 We apply several clearly defined stages for implementing CompleteRMP which make the transition from existing systems straightforward. We do this by setting up a "work in progress" system which we continually update &amp; customise until you are completely happy. We can then provide training on this temporary system before you go live to make sure everyone in your organisation is completely happy and ready before you switch over.</p>

									<p>The process starts with requirements gathering and our experienced consultants will advise you on the best way to customise CompleteRMP based on your specific requirements. If you are already using a system of any kind, we will discuss the data with you and in most cases can take a sample of your data and provide a fixed price quotation for data migration.</p>

									<p>We will then begin to customise the temporary system and start working on your data import. Once we have completed the data import, we will update the temporary system with your own data. You can then advise us on the imported data and if you would like to make any changes, for example you may want us to perform some data cleansing, duplicate checking or re-formatting.</p>

									<p>This is an iterative process and we will continue to update the temporary system based on your feedback and re-import the cleansed data until you are completely happy.</p>

									<p>We will then agree a day when you will stop using your existing system, at which time we will take a fresh copy of your existing data with any files and CV's and run our ready prepared import scripts. The temporary system will be updated once again and will be ready for you to start using as your new recruitment system.

									We offer bespoke programming services to our client base to provide additional functionality specific to the way they work and integrate this with their CompleteRMP product. Examples of this type of service would be to provide client specific tools that speed up internal processes such as synchronising with external systems. We can also develop any type of specific report and integrate it with your CompleteRMP system for example to be processed before management meetings and keep track of KPI's and sales forecasts.
								</p>
								<p>
									If suggested functionality would benefit the rest of our client base then this is included in the next product update for everyone so you will also benefit from tools and features suggested by the rest of our client base.

									The CompleteRMP development team are specialists in carrying out seamless website integrations and as CompleteRMP is completely web based, new and innovative features can easily be integrated into your website without incurring large development costs. Over the years, we have produced a suit of internet recruitment tools that can easily be "plugged in" to any website to provide the latest recruitment functionality.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can use our in-house creative design &amp; development team and extensive network of partners or we will work with your own designers to integrate our technology &amp; assist with website creation &amp; company branding. We can quickly build your website already configured with the latest recruitment technology such as candidate area / registration, dynamic vacancy pages, automatic CV data extraction, hiring manager access and intelligent pre-screening at a fraction of the cost for a bespoke development.

									The security of your data is our highest priority and every measure is taken to protect it. In fact, it is usually the case that our client's data is far more secure on our servers than on their own premises.
								</p>
								<p>
									Data security breaches can come from two main areas. First you must establish tight security within your own organisation. The comprehensive administration tools in our online recruitment solution will help with this as you have full control over each user's access rights and permissions. You can restrict users access to any area of CompleteRMP and even set the times they are allowed access for example to prevent access on evenings and weekends. You can also prevent individual user access from outside your own premises altogether.
								</p><p>
								</p>
									Our servers are maintained in a state of the art data centre and are monitored 24 x 7. All our servers are configured in the best possible way by professionals to eliminate external threats. They are protected from fire, power outages and theft through stringent security measures that wouldn't go amiss in an airport and are connected with multiple internet connections to eliminate down time. We use the latest corporate Anti Virus software and our hardware and software firewalls stop unauthorised access.
								<p>
									As a final precaution, our entire client's data is backed up daily and stored in a separate location.
